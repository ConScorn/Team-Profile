# Team-Profile

## IMPORTANT NOTE
This assignment was done as a class, and code used in this project was written by Scott Brunswig, our class instructor.

## Description
A web app that allows a user to add information regarding members of their team, for any project they make be working on. It acts as a contact list of sorts, displaying every team member's name, role, email, github page, and office number, if applicable. This web app seeks to aid teams in organization. It makes use of inquirer, to prompt the user for the information regarding team members. In developing this assignment, we learned to make better use of jest(to test node.js code without running it), npm packages, and node as a whole.
